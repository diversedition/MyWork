NOTES:
 Use an ArrayList instead of Object[], so the Object array can grow dynamically, then we won't really need to check capacity.

The pop(...) method should declare the checked exception it throws, which will help performance in those cases.  Plus it is cleaner.

If we were going into a multi-threaded environment we would need to sychronize push(...) and pop(...).
